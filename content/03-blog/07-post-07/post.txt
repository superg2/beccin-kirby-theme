"What do you do when you're tired of the prospect of dating? Two good friends with opposite relationship problems found themselves single at the same time. As an experiment, they dated for 40 days."

New York friends and designers Jessica Walsh and Timothy Goodman decided to embark on an adventure together after finding themselves both single at the same time. <A HREF="http://www.fortydaysofdating.com"target=blank>40 Days of Dating</A>, a record of their dates, tells their story as it develops over the 40 days, the ups and downs and inevitable dramas of two close friends trying to make something work.

Amongst the dates and tests the pair have also produced some beautiful typographic pieces recording certain aspects of their time together and feelings. Combining love and design in an unexpected way. It sounds like a crazy idea, but the hopeless romantic in me can't stop reading in the hope that they will get it together at the end. Everyone deserves a happily ever after.
