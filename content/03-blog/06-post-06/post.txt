Summer seems to have finally arrived, I've had flip flops on for at least a week and the thought of wearing socks is not a fond one. Swedish painter and photographer <A HREF="http://www.fredrikakum.com"target=blank>Fredrik Akum</A> is helping the summer spirit with his beautifully nostalgic pieces. I can't help but reminisce on childhood holidays to local beaches, sand between my toes and sun on my face...
