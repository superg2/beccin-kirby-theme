Love it or hate it, Glastonbury has changed. The original festival is more mainstream now than ever and with that in mind the BBC have launched a new identity for it's coverage. <A HREF="http://www.studio-output.com/"target=blank>Studio Output</A> worked on the new look, with a brief which encouraged them to "Think Beyonce!"

I actually like the way the logo is brought to life in the animation. The way the lighting effects travel across the triangle/pyramid stage is a clever way of interpreting the essence of the festival. It certainly does have a more 'bling' feeling to the original notion of what Glastonbury is all about.
