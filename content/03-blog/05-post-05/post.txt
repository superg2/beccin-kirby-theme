You've been working out, it's hot and sweaty, you want a shower and to feel clean. Look no further... A group of friends who run marathons together and have found it hard to find a range of cosmetics which meet their needs have created <A HREF="http://www.fisixsport.com//"target=blank>Fisix</A>. 

Fisix is a beautifully designed new brand, showcasing a range of cosmetics aimed at sportsmen and women, by <A HREF="http://www.wearemucho.com/"target=blank>Mucho</A> in Barcelona. The system mixes pastel colours with a hardy grey and crafted serif type, it aims to be unisex and the design has been kept clean and scientific in approach to achieve this, a feminine touch is added through the colour.

I'd try it...
