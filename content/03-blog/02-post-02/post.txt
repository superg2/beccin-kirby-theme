<A HREF="http://www.lucymcrae.net/"target=blank>Lucy McRae</A> is described as 'straddling the worlds of fashion, technology and the body. A body architect who invents and builds structures around the body that re-shape the human silhouette.' In her work with Aesop we see this statement come to life as she playfully highlights the science behind the Aesop brand and it products. Beautifully executed, resulting in an intriguing outcome.
